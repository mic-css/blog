            <h2 id="dayzero">Day Zero</h2>

<p>Today was our first day at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a>, and we were told that we would write no code. Instead, I learnt the names and birthplaces of more than 60 people in under one hour, met the CEO and tried vinyasa flow yoga for the first time. Because today was all about introducing us in earnest to how things are done here.</p>

<h3 id="whyzero">Why Zero?</h3>

<p>Today was day zero for several reasons: because we’re starting from scratch, re-wiring our brains and <a href="http://blog.makersacademy.com/learning-how-to-learn/">learning to learn</a>; because in computing, you start counting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering">at zero</a> (yep); and because, like with <a href="http://bit.ly/1SZAZ43">zero-days</a> (undisclosed computer application flaws that can be exploited by hackers) we were encouraged to expose our vulnerabilities, and take advantage of the overwhelming pressure we will be under in the coming twelve weeks to tap into our ambitions and fears to “become the best version of ourselves”. It does sound fluffy and new-age, I’ll concede, but I can assure you that it was refreshing to see people who barely know each other express authentic compassion, encouragement, a keenness to see each other succeed and an iron fist against discrimination and competition in an educational and professional environment.</p>

<h3 id="lifesanamegame">Life’s a Name Game</h3>

<p>First and foremost, we were treated to some breakfast: some welcome calories and stimulants in the Makers kitchen, respite from the cold London air among shy chitchat with the odd familiar face. Then a quick presentation and before we knew it we were stood up in a giant circle around the hall, north of 60 people between our cohort and the staff. Amid some sighs of reluctance, we were told we would be playing the name game.</p>

<p>“Oh great, another ‘team-building’ exercise,” you’d be forgiven for thinking, as I did. Instead, all we had to do was go around in a circle, saying our names and birthplaces, but only after having repeated those of every person preceding us. Never have I learnt so many people’s names in one go (not even close, and in under an hour to boot) and I could recite every one of them to you right now. Simple. Effective. And with quite a few laughs. No more awkward chitchat next to the coffee machine.</p>

<h3 id="selfandother">Self and Other</h3>

<p>The next presentation (read: conversation) was a touching and invigorating account from Dana, Makers’ <em>Chief Joy Officer</em>, and Jordan, one of Makers’ first alumni, on all things non-coding at Makers: tips on how to make it through the course, how to make the most of it, how to reach out for support, and how everyone is welcome, freaks, geeks, LGBTQs, muslims, buddhists, Germans from Singapore and Brits from Dubai — I couldn’t do the conversation justice, but here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>We will have to work hard: as Jordan put it, MA is like a personal trainer — it doesn’t matter if we pay them £800 or £8m, we’re still the ones who have to do the squats.</li>
<li>…But we will struggle: programming is unlike anything we’ve studied at school and failure is a central component of software development. We’ll feel stupid over and over again despite being smart and likely having found most things fairly easy in school and work up until this point. That’s part of the experience.</li>
<li>We will have to take care of ourselves: the long days, mental exhaustion, frustration, intense concentration and emotional rollercoaster that is the course will require us to listen to our bodies to avoid burnout — hence the 2pm meditation practice and twice-weekly yoga (a surprisingly good workout, as I found out).</li>
<li>Friends and family may not understand: if you’re reading this thinking, “what the hell is he on about?” then you fall into this category. This course will take up all of our time, don’t get mad if we don’t call back the same day. (To be fair the point here was to learn to communicate this <em>properly</em>.)</li>
<li>Communication is key: if you’ve heard this a million times, there’s a reason. Learning to communicate with peers, staff, mentors, pair partners, friends and family and learning to be genuine and authentic is the only way we’ll get through this, and what will ultimately put us ahead as developers and people.</li>
<li>Become the best version of yourself: this is a unique opportunity to dig deep and work hard to improve ourselves in every way we want to, without succumbing to the tendency of comparing ourselves to others.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="99bottlesofbeeronthewall">99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall</h2>

<p>After a few more presentations and a code <em>kata</em> (a coding exercise, from the Japanese for <em>form</em>, as in the choreographed movements repeated in martial arts as training) we naturally hit the pub. Oh and writing a program that prints all the lyrics to ’99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall’ is one of the first katas you do when learning to code — coincidence? </p>

<h2 id="yeahwhataboutlearningtocode">Yeah, What About Learning to Code??</h2>

<p>That starts tomorrow, and there will be LOTS of it, to the point that we will sometimes dream in code (yes, you read that right; it’s natural when you’re intently focused on something for many hours at a time). But learning to code is just the activity. The self-improvement and community-building is the core of the Makers philosophy. As the CEO of Lyst said, “I can teach anyone to code, but I can’t teach them not to be dicks.” This place may look like a school and sound like a cult, but today they taught us it’s a <em>tribe</em>.</p>
