            <h2 id="dojokun">Dojo Kun</h2>

<p>Coding bootcamps are intensive vocational programs aimed at teaching people of all ages and backgrounds how to code and they’re <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/05/3-signs-youll-soon-be-attending-a-coding-bootcamp-at-your-college/">rapidly</a> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-07/coding-classes-attract-college-grads-who-want-better-jobs">gaining</a> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-22/google-launches-a-developer-boot-camp-promising-jobs-for-graduates">traction</a>. There are a couple of high-profile names and a handful of new kids on the block, mostly in the U.S. and Europe, each with different methods and results; in this post I’ll explain how things work at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> — the bootcamp I’m currently attending — and introduce their take on some of the tech industry’s best practices.</p>

<p>The pitch? Twelve weeks of highly immersive learning to make you into a full-stack junior developer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Dōjō kun</strong>: a Japanese martial arts term literally meaning training hall rules. They are generally posted at the “front” of the dojo (<em>shomen</em>) and outline behaviour expected and disallowed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="gameplan">Game Plan</h2>

<p>Makers Academy is not a <em>school</em>. There are no lectures, no grades, no exams and no certificates (though there are plenty of frowns and blank stares when explaining this to friends and family). Each of the twelve weeks is dedicated to introducing a new topic, be it a language, framework or technology, and building on previous learning, with a particular focus on best practices (particularly <strong>extreme programming</strong>).</p>

<p>The technology stack focuses on Ruby on Rails and AngularJS, two of the most popular frameworks around, and of course all of the bells and whistles that come with them: <em>if you’re allergic to tech acronyms look away now!</em> OOD, relational databases, git, HTML/CSS/JS, Bootstrap, jQuery, HTTP, AJAX, MVC/MV*, Chicago vs. London-style and a slew of testing suites to name a few, plus all the opportunity in the world to explore! (Closing HTML tags got you down? Try HAML! Sick of missing out a semicolon? CoffeeScript is your friend!) One week is dedicated entirely to doing what you like and, in just five days, I ended up building a simple API for a to-do list app in Node.js, Express and MongoDB - all of which meant nothing to me three months ago, and none of which are taught on the course!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attitude. Methodology. Technology. In that order.
  — <cite>overheard at Makers</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems too good to be true, right? Nobody’s expecting to become a master of all of the above in just 12 weeks (16 if you count the pre-course work), but for beginners to be able to comfortably put every one of those things together to build an application is one hell of an achievement. So here’s how it’s done…</p>

<h2 id="challengify">Challengify</h2>

<p>If I didn’t lose you with the technology name-dropping, you might be wondering how you might learn all of the above if there are no lectures. Each week comes with a weekly challenge: a set of tasks, walkthroughs and resources to work through to build increasingly complex applications. Similarly, each weekend has a dedicated solo challenge to build another application, this time without guiding materials. The coaches are at hand and run twice-daily <strong>stand-ups</strong> (15 minute meetings in small groups to discuss successes and blockers) and <strong>break-outs</strong> (more in-depth discussions) on important or difficult subjects, and this flexibility allows them to tailor the course to each cohort.</p>

<p>I think the benefits of this approach are self-evident. Framing things as a challenge gives greater motivation and sense of achievement, and encapsulates the topics neatly. It gives you the flexibility to learn at your own pace, whichever way suits you best, as well as the freedom to explore the things that tickle your fancy. It can be improved on the fly, with students and alumni constantly contributing to the material (through pull requests on GitHub) and staff tweaking it and refreshing it constantly to incorporate feedback and keep it relevant. Notice how none of those things can be said about your university syllabus?</p>

<p>Crucially, you <em>learn by doing</em>. But more on that later.</p>

<h2 id="pairprogramming">Pair-programming</h2>

<p>This now widespread technique involves two programmers working on the same codebase simultaneously, often sitting side by side. If you’ve never tried coding, you should know that it is inherently solitary — have you ever tried writing an essay with another person?? Nevertheless, the benefits are enormous and the industry has caught on to this.</p>

<p>Simply put, it makes it easier to spot errors if two people are working on the same code, but most of all it allows the pair to think more broadly, discuss difficulties and alternatives, and ultimately contribute two diverse approaches. The interaction lets you to step out of your jumbled train of thought, forcing you to explain your reasonings and giving you the space to observe the work more objectively. It can often feel unnatural or frustrating, but it’s a learned skill akin to some kind of <strong>supercharged team-working</strong>.</p>

<p>It also just makes the whole thing more fun!</p>

<h2 id="testdriven">Test-driven</h2>

<p>Along with pairing, though far more divisive, <strong>test-driven development</strong> is one of the cornerstones of extreme programming and highly regarded at Makers (and some of the best software development companies). Along with pairing, it’s one of the most difficult things to wrap your head around when becoming a developer, but when it clicks you never go back.</p>

<p>The idea is to write some code by first writing a test for it. You watch this test fail. You then write the simplest code you can to make it work. It passes, so you improve (refactor) that code. Then you move on to the next test.</p>

<p>Sound backwards? But lets imagine that essay from earlier, or a client presentation. First you write down a key question; then you answer it in the simplest way possible; then you improve that answer to make sure it says exactly what you want it to, and move on to the next question. Just writing that example made me think it’s an excellent way to go about it! Your essay stays concise and to the point, covering all the key issues from the reader’s perspective without becoming muddled and growing out of hand from sitting down and writing whatever falls out of your head all in one long sitting. Simple.</p>

<h2 id="learningtolearn">Learning to Learn</h2>

<p>As mentioned, the coaches and staff at Makers fully embrace a philosophy of <em>learning by doing</em>: by providing resources and support, setting a challenge and then stepping back, they provide students with the opportunity to get to the answer themselves. This has a tremendous effect on problem solving and retention; after all, would you learn more from listening to a cook talk about the difference between a pie and a soufflé or by grabbing two or three recipe books, all the ingredients you can carry, and cracking away at it yourself for a whole weekend? Sure, you’re first attempt will look (and taste) like that weird thing you made out of play-dough when you were three that your parents still keep on the mantelpiece. But each time will become more intuitive as you learn from your mistakes and your brain can attach meaning and correlate concepts by the sheer act of doing.</p>

<p>There are a whole lot of mistakes to be made. Programming is about problem-solving, so there is no value in being spoon-fed a solution (much like life). It is difficult to come to terms with a reality in which you are consistently failing and feeling stupid, particularly to those who have been comfortably succeeding at school and work for many years, but solving that problem with your partner and seeing all your tests go green becomes a highly effective — and highly addictive — motivator that increases your learning exponentially.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>

<p>The final two weeks are, in true Makers style, dedicated to projects. The first is a three-day hackathon and the second is a fully fledged prototype, each of which is selected by voting up pitches at a “jamboree.” These, coupled with some of the weekly challenges, make for a very solid starting point to creating your online portfolio — and if there was ever a simple link between coding and art, that’s it right there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a gong on the third floor at Makers, and every time an alumni gets a job it is rung, and the whole room explodes into applause.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="isallofthisevenpossible">Is All of This Even Possible?</h2>

<p>The short answer is yes. It requires a lot of commitment, hard work and love for the craft. However, the teaching philosophy and environment makes it feel effortless and the attention to attitude and best-practices makes for great developers.</p>

<p>I only discussed a few of the aspects of life at Makers, some of which deserve (and will get) their own post, but there’s so much more going on, each with thoughtful and interesting reasons: self-setting salaries, regular yoga and meditation, an online version of the course, flashmobs and ping pong, meet-ups and hackathons… You can read all about them on the <a href="http://blog.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy blog</a>.</p>
