<p>JavaScript is taking over the internet. Even if you‚Äôve never written a single line of code you‚Äôve probably heard of this mysterious thing that lives in your browser and is only mentioned by people with waxed moustaches and plaid shirts.</p>

<p>There are good reasons why it‚Äôs penetrated the zeitgeist: it‚Äôs arguably the <a href="http://arc.applause.com/2016/03/22/javascript-is-the-worlds-dominant-programming-language/">most popular programming language in the world</a> and you interact with it every day when you‚Äôre browsing the web. Over the past couple of years it‚Äôs even gone <strong>full-stack</strong>; this means that you can now use JavaScript to write programs not only in the browser, but on the server that hosts your program, as well as the database that stores all of its information. This is a big deal, as it‚Äôs the only language that can do this.</p>

<p>However, JavaScript is a <strong>clunky</strong>, ugly language ‚Äî it‚Äôs a real pain to write, especially in comparison to hip, new languages like Ruby. And yet, in a recent <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology">survey</a>, more than 55% of developers use JavaScript, while only around 9% use Ruby. Even I fit into this paradigm to some extent: I <a href="http://mic-css.github.io/47-ronin/">went to coding bootcamp</a> to learn Ruby and somehow ended up writing my final project <em>entirely</em> in JavaScript. I‚Äôm still not sure if it‚Äôs just plain old masochism, but in this post I explain what, in my opinion, makes JavaScript the best love-hate relationship a programmer can have. Up first, a quick primer.</p>

<h2 id="javascriptwasntbuiltinaday">JavaScript Wasn‚Äôt Built In a Day</h2>

<p>JavaScript was infamously <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript">written in 10 days</a> üò± back in 1995. Its <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html#p_NnFf9SYflZ">purpose</a> was to add programs to web pages in the browser, and to its credit it‚Äôs still going strong more than 20 years later. Pretty much every modern website relies heavily on JavaScript, so you can probably appreciate its role in your everyday life ‚Äî email, news, directions, communications, Google‚Ä¶  It‚Äôs thanks to JavaScript that we have <strong>web apps</strong> (think software in your browser, like Netflix or Google Drive).</p>

<p>Unfortunately that reduced amount of time is painfully obvious when coding in JavaScript. It‚Äôs the butt of many programmer jokes (such as this <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">hilarious talk</a>) because it‚Äôs so quirky. You could easily spend an hour in a heated debate about whether or not you should use semicolons. <em>Semicolons!!!</em> More importantly though, its standard library ‚Äî the set of functionality that the language comes with ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù ‚Äî is <a href="https://medium.com/@thomasfuchs/what-if-we-had-a-great-standard-library-in-javascript-52692342ee3f#.nw0wjiqu0">relatively terrible</a>.</p>

<p>Every new version of the language tries to improve on this issue, however, such a foundational technology is difficult to change. When so many programs and websites use JavaScript, it‚Äôs almost impossible to make significant changes without simply pulling the rug out from underneath them. Every change has to be incremental, backwards-compatible and thoroughly discussed and reviewed. The entire process can be overwhelmingly difficult; One does not simply re-build the foundations of something. Witness the chaos caused by the roadworks to fix the foundations of the Hammersmith Flyover in West London! (Sorry, personal gripe‚Ä¶)</p>

<p>As a result, the JavaScript world has grown reliant on tiny <strong>packages</strong> that you can pull into your program to give you extra functionality: these are a great way to make your code more modular and cut down on development times, but when they‚Äôre not built into the language they risk being volatile. A recent trademark <a href="http://blog.christoffer.me/no-we-havent-forgotten-how-to-code-javascript-just-needs-to-become-a-better-language/">debacle</a> pushed a developer to withdraw his packages, including one (a whopping <em>11 lines of code</em>) that almost broke the internet as so many programs and applications depended on it for an arguably basic task. This all caused a lot of interesting debate about the past, present and future of JavaScript and will certainly improve the publishing process for packages, but it might not necessarily have an effect on JavaScript itself.</p>

<p>So why the hype?</p>

<h2 id="youdontnodewhatyoudontnode">You Don‚Äôt Node What You Don‚Äôt Node</h2>

<p>JavaScript's popularity might be an attractive enough reason to learn it in itself. Stack Overflow, the go-to online forum for programming questions, recently released its latest <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016">developer survey</a> -- something of a "State of the Union" affair in the developer word -- and JavaScript blew all other technologies out of the water in terms of both usage and interest.</p>

<p>Some of the most popular technologies out there at the moment, whether on developers' to-do list or employers' hit-list, are JavaScript variants or frameworks. Two salient names are <strong>AngularJS</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>, a front-end framework and a back-end environment respectively. This is a particularly clear indicator that JavaScript, the ugly duckling of modern programming languages, is taking over the stack in an impressive coup d'√©tat -- and not without some top-notch branding too, since one particular JavaScript stack has the catchy acronym <strong>MEAN</strong> (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS and Node.js).</p>

<p>A full-stack language is an entirely new paradigm in the programming world and its long-term viability remains to be proven, as mentioned earlier. Nonetheless, there are some clear benefits to having a full-stack language, the first of which is that developers can reuse their skills up and down the stack. This means tighter integration as developers are more au fait with the stack in its entirety, more reusability and mobility of developers and more standardisation in the industry. </p>

<p>Moreover, JavaScript lends itself particularly well to certain uses that are becoming more and more common on the web. Two such examples are: <br>
* Storing data in the same format that you would then use to send the information to the browser (<strong>JSON</strong>, or JavaScript Object Notation). Remember, your browser already speaks JavaScript.
* Handling high volumes of simultaneous traffic (<strong>concurrency</strong>), which is one of the reasons Node.js is being used at companies like Netflix, Uber and PayPal.</p>

<h2 id="onelanguagetorulethemall">One Language to Rule Them All</h2>

<p>JavaScript is like English: despite it being a vibrant pastiche of different languages with some mind-boggling rules, it is flexible and ubiquitous, making it an unlikely shoo-in as the <em>de facto</em> language of the web.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre a curious developer or someone who is thinking about learning to program, I strongly recommend looking into JavaScript, as it will open up many, many doors to exciting technologies and opportunities (as long as you can stomach a barrage of brackets and semicolons).</p>

<p>And whether or not you‚Äôre into code, next time you fire up Chrome, take a moment to appreciate the awesome and bizarre dark horse that is JS.</p>
