<p>You’ve probably been there. Staring at that exam paper or spreadsheet, your mind a million miles away, surfing the waves of your imagination. You can’t <em>focus</em>. You’re not <em>invested</em>. You don’t know why you’re doing what you’re doing - it’s not going to lead you to where you want to be. And you know this, even if you’re not sure where it is you want to be. Let’s face it, not everybody’s lucky enough to be able to choose what they want to do, and it’s true what they say, “it’s never too late.” And anyway it doesn’t matter what they say. <br>
Time for a change. Let’s do this.</p>

<p>It took me two tries to decide — to <em>realise</em> — that I wanted to become a developer. The first time, around the time I was graduating from university with a degree in management, I had a visceral feeling that I didn’t belong to the suit-clad, PowerPoint-wielding hordes of high-paid management consultants; that there was no purpose, nothing being created or nurtured, just a perpetuation of the systemic inefficiency and greed of corporations and our misguided dogma of 10-hour days and vertical promotions. The second time, and one Masters degree in Computer Science later, I was wearing a suit and wielding a PowerPoint presentation, working as an IT consultant for those corporations. Same visceral feeling, and something had to be done. Despite the fact I look damn good in a suit.</p>

<p>At university I had dabbled in programming in my spare time out of curiosity, watched a few screencasts and taken a few courses on <a href="http://bit.ly/1J5Sprl">Codecademy</a> and the likes. The subject could be a bit dry, but it was interesting stuff, as if someone had made a video game out of mathematics. I could see the potential; after all, this was the era of Facebook, Gmail, Angry Birds and WhatsApp. But I couldn’t join the dots to understand how all the different pieces fit.</p>

<p>However, that curiosity persisted, and more importantly I slowly started to realise that the opportunities were endless. This wasn’t a career path, it was a skill, a craft, even an art form. It meant having to flex your brain to learn new “languages” somewhere between a patois and an algebraic expression, solve difficult logic problems, research complex technologies and spend hours in front of a computer all to be able to print “Hello, World!” on your computer screen. Yet suddenly you were on the other side of that screen, peeking into this Pandora’s box that promised to show you “how” today’s world works.</p>

<p>And those opportunities were and still are the stuff of dreams. With a lot of time, effort and hard work I might end up working at a groundbreaking start-up, with exposed brick walls and a foosball table, or remote working from that exotic beach, or moving the needle at one of the tech giants, or even setting up my own company. Who knows! But all the while I’d be learning and improving at this powerful new skill, putting in my <a href="http://read.bi/1W4CT31">10,000 hours</a>.</p>

<p>So after a year in a comfy, high-paying consulting job, I decided to join <a href="http://bit.ly/1cznjV3">Makers Academy</a>. This blog is the story of how I spent 12 weeks with 47 curious, ambitious young men and women who set off on a path into this strange new world of software development — 47 rōnin, samurai with no master — and the team of bandits, teachers and mentors who gave us a home and a sword.</p>
