# Ronin

Welcome to my little corner of headspace in the long-tail of the internet. My posts focus on lessons-learned from my recent deep-dive into the world of software development, hopefully in a way that is approachable to all, non-techies included.

Expect rants, tips, anecdotes and lots of "strong opinions held weakly."

For a more social experience, you can find my posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mic_css). Comment, like, follow, do the raindance -- it's all good!
